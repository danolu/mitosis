	<description>
		This method is used to programmatically control the calendar month that is shown to the end user. That can be useful for jumping around long time periods, or encouraging users to enter data in a specific month.

		It might typically be used with a `change` or `focus` event listener. The get value should only be relied upon when the calendar display is shown (field has focus), and the setter will only have an affect under the same condition.
